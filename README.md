# Home Automation with ESP8266 NodeMCU, WiFi based ON-OFF Relay
This is a simple Home Automation project using the DIY micro-controller (ESP8266) with firmware developed over arduino. This setup can be used to control the relay from any web browser using the wireless network.

## Step 1: Gather Materials
1. ESP8266 NodeMCU (https://www.amazon.in/Lolin-NodeMCU-ESP8266-CP2102-Wireless/dp/B010O1G1ES)
2. 8-Channel 5V Relay Module (http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=8_Channel_5V_Relay_Module)
3. F2F JUMPER WIRES (20CM) 20PCS (https://www.olelectronics.com/F2F-Jumper-Wires--20-PCs)

All the components are avalable in the local electronics market or over Amazon online store. Please make necessary changes in the code based on the board you use.
