# Home Automation with ESP8266, WiFi based ON-OFF Relay
This is a simple Home Automation project using the DIY micro-controller (ESP8266) with firmware developed over arduino. This setup can be used to control the relay from any web browser using the wireless network.

## Step 1: Gather Materials
1. Arduino Nano R3 (https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano)
2. Bluetooth Module HC-05 (https://wiki.eprolabs.com/index.php?title=Bluetooth_Module_HC-05)
3. 8-Channel 5V Relay Module (http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=8_Channel_5V_Relay_Module)
4. F2F JUMPER WIRES (20CM) 20PCS (https://www.olelectronics.com/F2F-Jumper-Wires--20-PCs)

All the components are avalable in the local electronics market or over Amazon online store. Instead of Arduino Nano R3.x used here, you can also use the Arduino Uno R3 board. Please make necessary changes in the code based on the board you use.
